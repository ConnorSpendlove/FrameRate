## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of our project was originally to create a simple forum where users can post and share their thoughts based on a game they can search up from an API database of games. They would be able to comment on other posts and utilize a search bar to find games they want to interact with. However, the scope of the project was a bit too large for the amount of time we had, and our knowledge was not quite to the point of efficiently accomplishing our intended goal within that time.

Nevertheless, we decided to retain the ability for the user to manually input their own reviews, comments, and hours invested into a specified game. These posts can be seen in their account and can be used as a diary to keep track of their virtual accomplishments. We hope to improve this website in the future and add the intended features we did not have the effective means to add previously.
